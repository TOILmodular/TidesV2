*) Depending on the LEDs used, they might be too bright. The resistor labeled as "LED<XXX>" can be used to adjust the brightness by reducing the current. The labeling "LEDR" and "LEDG" refer to the red and green parts of the bi-color LEDs of the mode selections. "LEDOUT" is for the four output LEDs.
